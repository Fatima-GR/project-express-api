# Express API Project

This is a backend project building an API in NODE using Express. The API has a bunch of routes to get to endpoints. The data has been manipulated by filtering so that different data is displayed depending on the endpoint.

I started the project by choosing a JSON file to work with (Books info) and to create a first endpoint that displays all objects in the JSON file. I then tried out params to create an endpoint that displays a single object from the JSON file, using the find-method to catch specific object ids. I continued creating another endpoint for the titles with params, and then with queries, using the filter method. By using queries I created endpoints to display arrays of objects depending on the author and title.
